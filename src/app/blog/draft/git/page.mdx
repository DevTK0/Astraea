I'm currently working on figuring out a good git workflow.

Things i'm learning:
- [x] Rebase
- [ ] Squashing
- [ ] Stack Diffs

Best Practices:
- Merge vs Rebase

## Rebasing
Rebasing is when you move an entire branch to the front of your current branch.
```git
git rebase BRANCH-NAME
```

## Merging
Merging is when you integrate changes from another branch to your current branch as a new commit.

```git
git merge BRANCH-NAME
```

## Rebasing vs Merging
- Rebasing ends up with a cleaner commit history.
- You end up with a single linear history.
- Merging results in the merging commit having two parents.
- Merging creates "duplicate" history through the merge commit.
